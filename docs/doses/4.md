# 4 - Exhaustiveness checking with mypy

This technique is handy if thereâ€™s logic which should explicitly handle all possible values of an enumeration. With the example, mypy would kindly hint that BLUE is unhandled:

```
example.py 17: error: Argument 1 to "assert_never" has incompatible type "Literal[Color.BLUE]"; expected "NoReturn"
```

In addition to Enums, works great with e.g. Unions and Literals!
