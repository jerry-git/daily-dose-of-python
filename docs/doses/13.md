# 13 - Quart
Quart is an ASGI re-implementation of the Flask API with some added ASGI specific features, such as websockets.
If you have a Flask project and would like to go truly async, migrating to Quart is an option.
Quart recently became a Pallets project (the folks behind Flask, Click, Jinja, etc) and they apparently intend to merge Quart and Flask to eventually have ASGI support in Flask.
