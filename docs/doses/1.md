# 1 - Union vs TypeVar

On the left, the imaginary example program would crash on the lines 8 and 9.
Mypy could not help with it.
On the right, mypy would complain about the lines 8 and 9, which is probably what we want.
So, TypeVar is a better choice if the type must be consistent across multiple uses within a given scope.
