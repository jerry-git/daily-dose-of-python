Hi, I'm Jerry ðŸ‘‹

I work as a Python Competence Lead at [Wolt](https://wolt.com/). I'm mainly using Python for web development but the content of the _Daily dose of Python_ has more general focus.  

I've been actively following the vibrant Python ecosystem for several years. The language has evolved quite a bit during the recent years.
One of my goals with the _Daily dose of Python_ is to showcase what _modern_ Python looks and feels like.
